<h2> Summary of Module </h2>

This module offers strategies and implications for using antiracist genre systems (i.e., altering classroom genres and responses) to create safe writing classroom spaces for students and faculty. 

<h2> Key ideas and concepts </h2>

* Black Critical Geographies in Writing and Rhetoric
* Trauma-informed pedagogies (TIP)
* Antiracist Social Actions
* Rhetorical genres / Genre Systems
* Thinking of safety and Fostering Safe Spaces in academic settings 

<h2> What is safety, from an antiracist perspective? </h2>

From an antiracist perspective antiracist perspective, safety is not about dis/comfort. Safety,more accurately, is about survival—and having access to resources, communities, and support necessary to survival and well-being. For some students, especially Black and marginalized students, our classrooms have never been safe.

<h2> How has safety come up in academic scholarship? </h2>

Institutional un/safety is a long-standing subject of discussion amongst Black feminist researchers and scholar-activists across disciplines. Race/-ism and anti-Blackness have been overlooked in TIP research. While the list below is by no means exhaustive, it offers some context for how  scholarship across disciplines has already brought attention to Black and marginalized people's un/safety in academic spaces. 

* “Which black or other marginalized faculty is safe in the academy, ever? Who are these safe
people? Where are they?” - Katherine McKittrick
from “[Canada and the Question of Black Geographies](https://www.pdcnet.org/collection-anonymous/browse?fp=clrjames&fq=clrjames%2FVolume%2F8980%7C20%2F),” an Interview Peter J. Hudson
* “...our classrooms were serving as Black spaces of safety and refuge for our Black students and for us. Probing further, we discovered that safety and refuge were taking shape as short-lived moments of Black joy and other pleasurable affects that were percolating in our classrooms.” -
Esther O. Ohito and Keffrelyn D. Brown from Esther O. Ohito and Keffrelyn D. Brown’s “[Feeling Safe from the Storm of
anti-Blackness](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03626784.2020.1843966?casa_token=t3nl6NfwG6AAAAAA:sftEURarYIX_XRrk62f8N5rO_oJBL736FIRr6hTkRkH-qMUR2BuNAuEnEaJ_HojVb8Fac9Cxbu8EGQ)" 
* “What happens when you can’t experience safety in your cave because the bear is living in the
cave with you?” - Melissa Tayles, citing Nadine Burke Harris from Melissa Tayles’ “[Trauma Informed Writing Pedagogy](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2526905410?fromopenview=true&pq-origsite=gscholar)” 

When we prioritize the safety of our marginalized students and colleagues, it is an act of care.

<h2> How do we apply antiracist theory to different classroom spaces? </h2>
Antiracist pedagogies and a Black Critical Geographic approach (Graphenreed & Poe) offer possibilities for curating safer classroom spaces.
We can transform and stabilize classroom spaces through antiracist and trauma-informed practices. Following Katherine McKittrick, “alterability is a pathway” to a more human(e) understandings of—and actions within—space (Demonic Grounds, 2006).
